# Checkout application

## Task description
You are to build an application that simulates a shop checkout system. You must build only the application (Work in scripts/checkout.js)

The app reads the requests from orders.js and from employees.js and has to process it, and return the final price.

## Data
### Employees.js
This file provides a variable called employees, that represents the data of the employees, with the following format:
```javascript
var employees = [
    {
        id: 1, // int, unique
        firstName: "The name of the employee", // string
        lastName: "The name of the employee", // string
        discount: 10, // value that must be from 0 to 70 - represents the discount that the employee has inside the store
    }
];
```
### Items.js
This file provides a variable called items, representing an array of items available in the store
```javascript
var items = [
    {
        code: 1, //int, unique
        name: "the name of the item", //string
        price: 10.0// float, price per item 
    }
];
```
### Orders.js
This file provides a variable called orders, representing an array of orders to be processed
```javascript
var orders = [

        ],
        employee: 1 // opt, the id of the employee
    }
]
```

]
```
